In this articles, I discuss my 2 submissions for the IMC prosperity trading competition that took place in April 2024. 
We were tasked to develop trading strategies for a range of fictional securitie.
I focused on 2 securities: AMETHYSTS and STRAFRUIT.In the artciles in this folder, I describe the trading strategies I came up with, as well as their implementation and results.
For AMETHYSTS, I developped a mean reverting strategy. The details are in the jupyter notebook "Article AMETHYSTS.ipynb".
For STARFRUIT, I devdlopped a trend following (momentum) strategy. The details are in the Jupyter notebook "Article STARFRUIT.ipynb".
